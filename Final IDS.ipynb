# ## DATA DESCRIPTION
# 
# 1) Top 250 most expensive football transfers from season 2000-2001 until 2018-2019.
# 
# 2) 4700 total rows and 10 columns.

# ## GOAL
# 
# To predict the transfer value of players for the next two years by analyzing previous 8 years of data. 
# 
# ## TARGET AUDIENCE
# 
# 1) Soccer Enthusiasts
# 
# 2) Fantasy Soccer Leagues
# 
# ## OBJECTIVE
# 
# So far we have cleaned our data and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# 
# --DATA CLEANING:
# 
#     1) Removing Whitespaces
#     2) Convering string attributes into lower_case
#     3) Removing NA's
#     4) Removing Nan's
#     5) Creating separate dataframes according to Season attribute
#     
# --EDA:
# 
#     1) Whether clubs are more interested in buying or selling players
#     2) Dig deep into basic distribution of the data
#     3) Top Leagues and Teams as per Transfer value
#     4) Showing plots for top selling & buying clubs and top selling & buying leagues

# ## Data Cleaning 

# ### 1) Removing WhiteSpaces

# In[193]:


scr.columns =  scr.columns.str.strip()


# ### 2) Converting to Lower_case

# In[194]:


# converting 'Name' column to lower case
scr["Name"]=scr["Name"].str.lower()

# converting 'Position' column to lower case
scr["Position"]=scr["Position"].str.lower()

# converting 'Team_from' column to lower case
scr["Team_from"]=scr["Team_from"].str.lower()

# converting 'League_from' column to lower case
scr["League_from"]=scr["League_from"].str.lower()

# converting 'Team_to' column to lower case
scr["Team_to"]=scr["Team_to"].str.lower()

# converting 'League_to' column to lower case
scr["League_to"]=scr["League_to"].str.lower()


# ### 3) Removing NA's

# In[195]:


# checking which columns contain NA values

# ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# In our Exploratory Data Analysis we will be exploring the following: 
# 
#     1) Whether clubs are more interested in buying or selling players
#     2) Dig deep into basic distribution of the data
#     3) Top Leagues and Teams as per Transfer value
#     4) Showing plots to see the following:
#         a) Top Selling Clubs 
#         b) Top Buying Clubs 
#         c) Top Selling Leagues
#         d) Top Buying Leagues 

# ### 1) Whether clubs are more interested in buying or selling players

# In[196]:

print('\n')
print('There is a good difference in count of selling clubs and buying clubs this means that some clubs are more interested in buying from other rather than growing academy players.')


# ### 2) Dig deep into basic distribution of the data

# Here we will do a basic analysis to see our basic distribution of our data

# In[197]:


import pandas as pd

# In[201]:


top_10_buying_leagues = pd.DataFrame(scr['League_to'].value_counts())
top_10_buying_leagues.head(10)


# The most transferred player is 'Alex'. 
# 
# The club that sells and buys the most is 'Inter Milan'.
# 
# Transfers IN/OUT happened the most in 'Premier League'.

# ### 3) Top Leagues and Teams as per Transfer value

# In[202]:


top_10_selling_clubs_money = scr.groupby('Team_from',as_index = False)['Transfer_fee'].sum().sort_values(by = 'Transfer_fee',ascending = False)

# As of now, we have come up with the following analysis:
# 
# 1) The richest league - English Premier League
# 
# 2) Clubs that are the biggest sellers in the market, top5: Monaco, FC Porto, Real Madrid, Chelsea, Liverpool
# 
# 3) Clubs that are the b iggest buyers in the market, top5: Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Man Utd
# 

# ### 4) Plots to see the follwing: 
#     a) Top Selling Clubs 
#     b) Top Buying Clubs 
#     c) Top Selling Leagues
#     d) Top Buying Leagues

plt.tight_layout()


# From above plots we can see the following 
# 
# 1) Porto ,Benfica and Udinese Calcio are amongst the top sellers but not in the top buyers 
# 
# 2) Inter seems to be the squad that has changed a lot as it is on top for buying and selling list.
# 
# 3) A lot of players have left Serie A and Ligue 1 and most probably joined Premier League .
# 
# 4) It also signifies that these leagues maybe now have more homegrown players with each passing season.

# ## Conclusion:
# 
# The accuracy score for our Regression model is 48%, which is clearly not what we expected. The main reason for this, is that the predicted variables didn't quite explain the dependent variable, which is Transfer fee.
# R square value is 72%, so, 72% of variance is explained by our model.
# We tried different values of K. When the K value is 25 the results are optimal. The overall accuracy of KNN model is 71.6%, which is not that ideal.
# So, the final conclusion is: If the predictor variables would have been different we could have explained the Transfer fee for the player more efficiently.
